## Pre-launch Checklist

Run through every item before triggering `mainnet-deploy.yml`.

| # | Check | Command / Verification |
|---|-------|------------------------|
| 1 | Database healthy | `GET /health/ready` → `components.db.ok: true` |
| 2 | Redis healthy | `GET /health/ready` → all components ok |
| 3 | Issuer wallet configured | `STELLAR_ISSUER_PUBLIC_KEY` set and passes `G[A-Z0-9]{55}` regex |
| 4 | Distributor wallet configured | `STELLAR_DISTRIBUTOR_PUBLIC_KEY` set and passes regex |
| 5 | Horizon endpoint verified | `HORIZON_URL` points to `https://horizon.stellar.org` |
| 6 | JWT secrets configured | `JWT_SECRET` present in production environment |
| 7 | `MAINNET_CONTRACT_ID` secret set | GitHub → Settings → Secrets → `MAINNET_CONTRACT_ID` |
| 8 | `RENDER_BACKEND_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` set | GitHub → Settings → Secrets |
| 9 | All CI checks green on `main` | CI workflow must have passed before triggering |
| 10 | `npm run verify:data-integrity` passes | Run locally or check last CI run |
| 11 | Database migrations applied | `npm run migration:run -w backend` |
| 12 | Frontend/backend config consistent | `node scripts/deploy-consistency-check.mjs mainnet` (see Issue #842) |

## Validation

### Mainnet Readiness Endpoint

The deploy consistency script validates that frontend and backend are configured
with matching contract IDs, network passphrases, Horizon URLs, and Soroban RPC
URLs before cutover. Run it as part of pre-launch validation:

```bash
node scripts/deploy-consistency-check.mjs mainnet
```

A successful run emits `PASS` (exit 0). Failures print actionable messages
identifying mismatched or missing values. Warnings indicate potential issues
that should be reviewed but don't block deployment.

### Mainnet Readiness Endpoint

```bash
GET /ops/mainnet-readiness
```

All four checks must return `"status": "pass"`:

```json
{
  "ready": true,
  "timestamp": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "checks": [
    { "name": "environment",     "status": "pass" },
    { "name": "stellar-network", "status": "pass" },
    { "name": "wallet-config",   "status": "pass" },
    { "name": "database",        "status": "pass" }
  ]
}
```

If any check returns `"fail"`, **do not proceed** until the issue is resolved.

### Health Endpoints

```bash
GET /health/live    # → { "status": "ok" }
GET /health/ready   # → { "status": "ready", "components": { ... } }
GET /health/startup # → { "status": "started" }
```

## CI/CD Pipeline — `mainnet-deploy.yml`

The workflow enforces a strict gate sequence:

```
validate-mainnet-config
  └─► verify-backend-mainnet   (lint + build + test)
        └─► mainnet-readiness-gate   (polls /ops/mainnet-readiness)
              └─► deploy-mainnet   (triggers Render hook)
                    └─► post-deploy-smoke   (polls /health/ready)
                          └─► notify-on-failure   (prints rollback steps on failure)
```

**Key safety properties:**
- `cancel-in-progress: false` — an in-flight mainnet deploy is never cancelled by a concurrent run.
- Required secrets (`MAINNET_CONTRACT_ID`, `RENDER_BACKEND_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL`) are asserted before any deploy step runs.
- The `production` GitHub environment gate requires manual approval if configured.

### Triggering a Deploy

1. Navigate to **Actions → Mainnet Deploy → Run workflow**.
2. Leave `deploy_target` as `render` (default) unless overriding.
3. Leave `deploy_environment` as `production`.
4. Click **Run workflow**.

---

## Launch Steps

1. Confirm all pre-launch checklist items are complete.
2. Trigger `mainnet-deploy.yml` via GitHub Actions UI.
3. Monitor the `validate-mainnet-config` job — it will fail fast if secrets are missing.
4. Monitor `verify-backend-mainnet` — lint, build, and tests must pass.
5. Monitor `mainnet-readiness-gate` — polls `/ops/mainnet-readiness` up to 10 times.
6. Monitor `deploy-mainnet` — Render deploy hook is triggered.
7. Monitor `post-deploy-smoke` — polls `/health/ready` for up to 5 minutes.
8. Confirm all jobs are green before announcing availability.

---

## Rollback

### Fast Rollback (< 5 minutes)

1. **Identify the last stable deploy** in the Render dashboard (Services → stardial-backend → Deploys).
2. Click **Rollback** on the last known-good deploy in Render, or re-trigger the previous deploy hook.
3. Verify recovery:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.stardial.com/health/ready
   curl https://api.stardial.com/ops/mainnet-readiness
   ```
4. Confirm all four readiness checks return `"pass"`.

### Database Migration Rollback

If a migration caused the failure:

```bash
npm run migration:revert -w backend
```

Then redeploy the previous backend version.

### Contract Emergency Pause

If the on-chain contract is misbehaving:

1. Call `pause_distributions` using the admin wallet.
2. Communicate the pause to users via status page.
3. Investigate before calling `unpause_distributions`.

### Full Revert

1. Revert the git commit that changed contract ID configs.
2. Re-run deploy pipelines for backend and frontend only.
3. **Do not delete old contract IDs on-chain** — funds may remain there.

## Operational Impact

| Step | Downtime | Data Risk |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Backend redeploy | Brief restart (~30s) | None if DB unchanged |
| DB migration | None (online migration) | Low — always test on staging first |
| Contract deploy (new ID) | None until cutover | Old contract remains on-chain |
| Pause distributions | Distribute blocked | Deposits safe |

---

## Monitoring After Launch

- **Health dashboard:** `GET /health/ready` — check `components` for any degraded service.
- **Mainnet readiness:** `GET /ops/mainnet-readiness` — all checks must remain `pass`.
- **Logs:** Structured JSON logs via `winston`; filter by `level: "error"` for anomalies.
- **Sentry:** Monitor for new error spikes in the `production` environment.
- **Horizon / Soroban RPC latency:** Watch configured endpoints for elevated response times.
